# this is the "requirements.txt" file!
#
# main purposes of the "requirements.txt" file:
#
#  1) signals to humans and computers / servers alike that "there is a python app in this repo"
#  2) helps facilitate the installation of third-party packages our program requires (usually via a pip installation step)
#  3) aids in other people's ability to setup our programs (prevents errors related to ininstalled packages)
#
# how to use the requirements.txt file?
#
#  1) we write the names of all third-party packages our program requires in order to work properly, each on their own line, and make sure the file is saved
#  2) then we return to the command-line and run: `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the repo's root directory, to install the listed packages
