# shopping-cart
Improve your grocery store's operations by using this code to automate receipts!
## Setup
If using third party packages, create a virtual environment:
```sh
conda create -n shoppingcart-env python=3.8
```
Then activate that virtual environment:
```sh
conda activate shoppingcart-env
```
## Usage (including store customization)

Set a custom name and website url for your grocery store by changing the name and url in the quotation marks. Then create your receipt by running the 'python game.py' code.

```sh
STORE_NAME="JOHN'S GROCERY MARKET" STORE_URL="www.johnsgrocerymarket.com" python game.py
```
